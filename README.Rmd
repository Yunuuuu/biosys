The goal of biosys is to make it easy to run system command from R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of biosys from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WangLabCSU/biosys")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
library(biosys)
```

To build a `command`, simply use `exec`. The first argument is the command name,
and you can also provide the full path. After that, pass the command parameters.
This will create a `command` object:
```{r}
exec("echo", "$PATH")
```

To run the command, just pass the `command` object to the `cmd_run()`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(TEST = "biosys is awesome")
exec("echo", "$TEST") |> cmd_run()
Sys.unsetenv("TEST")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
Sys.setenv(TEST = "biosys is awesome")
x <- exec("echo", "$TEST") |> cmd_run(stdout = TRUE)
Sys.unsetenv("TEST")
cat(x, sep = "\n")
```

Several functions allow you to control the environment when running the command:

  - `cmd_wd`: define the working directory.
  - `cmd_envvar`: define the environment variables.
  - `cmd_envpath`: define the `PATH`-like environment variables.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
exec("echo", "$TEST") |>
    cmd_envvar(TEST = "biosys is very awesome") |>
    cmd_run()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
x <- exec("echo", "$TEST") |>
    cmd_envvar(TEST = "biosys is very awesome") |>
    cmd_run(stdout = TRUE)
cat(x, sep = "\n")
```

`biosys` provides several built-in functions for directly executing specific
commands., these include:
[alleleCounter](https://github.com/cancerit/alleleCount),
[cellranger](https://www.10xgenomics.com/cn/support/software/cell-ranger/latest),
[fastq_pair](https://github.com/linsalrob/fastq-pair),
[gistic2](https://broadinstitute.github.io/gistic2/),
[KrakenTools](https://github.com/jenniferlu717/KrakenTools),
[kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki/Manual),
[perl](https://www.perl.org/), [pySCENIC](https://github.com/aertslab/pySCENIC),
[python](https://www.python.org/), [seqkit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/),
[trust4](https://github.com/liulab-dfci/TRUST4).

For these commands, you can also use `cmd_help()` to print the help document.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
python() |> cmd_help()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
x <- python() |> cmd_help(stdout = TRUE)
cat(x, sep = "\n")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
perl() |> cmd_help()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
x <- perl() |> cmd_help(stdout = TRUE)
cat(x, sep = "\n")
```

And it is very easily to extend for other commands.

One of the great features of `biosys` is its ability to translate the R pipe
(`%>%` or `|>`) into the Linux pipe (`|`). All functions used to create a
`command` object can accept another `command` object. The internal will capture
the first unnamed input value. If it is a `command` object, it will be removed
from the call and saved. When the `command` object is run, the saved command
will be passed through the pipe (`|`) to the command.

```{r}
tmpdir <- tempdir()
file <- tempfile(tmpdir = tmpdir)
data.table::fwrite(
    x = list(letters),
    file = file,
    quote = FALSE,
    na = "NA",
    col.names = FALSE,
    logical01 = FALSE,
    showProgress = FALSE,
    verbose = FALSE
)
file2 <- tempfile()
exec("gzip", "-c", file) |>
    exec("gzip", "-d", ">", file2) |>
    cmd_run()
identical(readLines(file), readLines(file2))
```

## Session Informations
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
